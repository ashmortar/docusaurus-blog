# [ashmortar.io](https://ashmortar.io)

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator. It is my personal website and blog.

## Installation

```console
yarn install
```

## Local Development

```console
yarn start
```

This command starts a local [development server](http://localhost:3000) and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```console
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

##

```console
yarn serve
```

this command serves the production bundle at `--port` or [default](http://localhost:3000)
